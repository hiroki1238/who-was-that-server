# Claude AI Development Guidelines

## Project Overview
This is the `who-was-that-server` project - a Go-based backend server for the "Who Was That?" application.

## Working with Claude

### Code Review and Suggestions
- Claude can help review Go code for best practices
- Ask for optimization suggestions for performance-critical sections
- Request security review for authentication and data handling
- Get suggestions for error handling improvements

### Development Tasks
- Database schema design and migrations
- API endpoint implementation
- Authentication and authorization logic
- Testing strategies and test case generation
- Documentation and code comments

### Go-Specific Areas
- Goroutine and concurrency patterns
- Memory management and performance optimization
- Error handling patterns
- Interface design
- Package organization

### Architecture Discussions
- Microservices vs monolithic architecture decisions
- Database design (PostgreSQL optimization)
- Caching strategies
- API design (REST vs GraphQL)
- Deployment and infrastructure considerations

## Code Standards
- Follow the `.cursorrules` file for coding standards
- Maintain high test coverage
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document complex business logic

## Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication token handling
- Database query security (SQL injection prevention)
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting implementation

## Performance Guidelines
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies
- Connection pooling
- Memory usage monitoring
- Load testing considerations

## Documentation
- Keep README.md updated
- Document API endpoints
- Maintain changelog
- Include setup and deployment instructions
